## Project Vision

A **family meal planning PWA** that feels like a premium, $1M product. The goal is the most beautiful, user-friendly food planning experience on mobile *and* desktop — think Notion-meets-a-Michelin-star-restaurant. Every pixel, interaction, and micro-animation should feel intentional and delightful.

**Core audiences:**
- Primary: Mom/Dad on their phone in the grocery store
- Secondary: Planner mode on iPad or desktop during Sunday meal prep

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 16.2.6** (App Router, React 19) — READ `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next.js code |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| State | Zustand 5 (`src/store/useMealStore.ts`) |
| Database | PostgreSQL via **Neon serverless** |
| ORM | **Prisma 7** with `@prisma/adapter-neon` |
| Auth | **Clerk** (`@clerk/nextjs` v7) |
| AI | Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) — recipe import via URL, photo & pasted text. URL/text use Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5`); photo uses Sonnet vision. All use structured outputs (`output_config.format` json_schema) for guaranteed-parseable JSON |
| Styling | **CSS Modules** + global design tokens in `globals.css` |
| Icons | **lucide-react** — all UI chrome. Food/recipe emoji kept as user content (in tinted containers) |
| Fonts | Playfair Display (headings/serif accent) · DM Sans (body) — loaded via Google Fonts |
| PWA | Inline manifest in `layout.tsx`, apple-web-app-capable, standalone display |

### Data flow

1. `page.tsx` (Server Component) fetches all data for the current week via Prisma → passes as props to `MealPlannerApp`.
2. `MealPlannerApp` calls `useMealStore.getState().setInitialData()` on mount to hydrate Zustand.
3. User actions → Zustand action → optimistic UI update → `fetch()` to API route → Prisma → Neon DB.
4. Week navigation calls `fetchWeek()` which re-fetches from API.

## Data Models

```ts
Recipe       { id, userId, emoji, name, sub, tags: string[], color, instructions?, ingredients: Ingredient[] }
Ingredient   { id, recipeId, name, qty, unit, cat: IngredientCat, store: Store, noScale: boolean }
WeekEntry    { id, dayKey, weekYear, weekNum, type: 'empty'|'meal'|'note', recipeId?, guests?, note? }
RecurringMeal{ id, key (user-defined slug), label, recipeId? }
IngredientPrice { name (lowercase key), price }
ShoppingCheck{ itemKey, checked, weekYear, weekNum }
```

Ingredient categories: `proteins | produce | dairy | pantry`
Stores: user-defined strings; seeded as `Sprouts`, `Costco` on first use — managed via `/api/stores` and the ShopView ⚙ panel
Day keys: `Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun`

## Design System

### Philosophy
**Premium · Warm · Calm.** The visual language is a warm editorial style — like a high-end food magazine meets a productivity app. Nothing should look "app-like" or clinical. Use white space aggressively. Let content breathe.

### Design Tokens (`globals.css :root`)
```css
/* Color */
--bg:   #FDF8F0   /* warm off-white page background */
--sur:  #fff      /* card/surface white */
--br:   #2C1810   /* rich dark brown — primary text */
--terra:#B5522A   /* terracotta — today highlight, primary CTA */
--sage: #4A7A52   /* sage green — success, keto tag, secondary CTA */
--gold: #C4956A   /* warm gold — accent */
--mu:   #9B8B7B   /* muted warm grey — secondary text */
--bdr:  #EFE6DC   /* warm beige border */

/* Spacing  */ --sp-1..8     /* 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 */
/* Radius   */ --r-sm/md/lg  /* 10 / 14 / 18 */ · --r-pill /* 100 */
/* Elevation*/ --shadow-sm/md/lg  /* soft, layered, low-opacity */
/* Motion   */ --ease (cubic-bezier) · --dur (180ms)
```
Use these tokens — don't freehand spacing/radius/shadow values.

### Typography
- **Headings / accents**: `Playfair Display` (serif, italic for elegance)
- **Body / UI**: `DM Sans` (clean, rounded, modern sans)
- The combination creates a "food editorial" feel — newspaper meets app

### Day Colors (week grid)
```
Mon #4A6FA5  Tue #4A7A52  Wed #A0652A  Thu #B54A2A  Fri #8B3A2A  Sat #C47A4A  Sun #6A4A8A
```

### Tag Colors — restrained 3-color semantic palette
```
diet (keto)                         → sage  #3A6B42
time (meal-prep · 30 min)           → gold  #A0652A
occasion (crowd-pleaser · fun night · date night) → terra #B5522A
```
Tags render as **soft tinted pills** (colored text on a 10%-alpha tint of the same hue), not solid-fill white-text pills.

### Design Goals (the "million dollar" standard)
- **Mobile-first, desktop-great.** Every component must look perfect at 375px AND 1440px.
- **Touch targets ≥ 44px** on all interactive elements.
- **Micro-animations**: subtle scale on press (0.97), smooth transitions (150–250ms ease).
- **No layout jank.** Fixed shell (`100dvh`), scrollable content area only.
- **Safe areas.** Always use `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for iOS notch/home bar.
- **Loading states.** Every async action shows feedback — skeleton, spinner, or optimistic update.
- **Empty states.** Every empty list/state has a beautiful illustration-style icon + copy.
- **Modals as sheets.** On mobile, modals slide up from bottom; on desktop, centered dialog.
- **Consistent radii.** Cards: 16–20px. Pills/tags: 100px. Inputs: 12px.
- **Shadows sparingly.** Use borders + background color shifts instead of heavy drop shadows.

### Responsive Breakpoints
```
Mobile:  < 768px   (primary design target)
Tablet:  768–1024px
Desktop: > 1024px  (sidebar layout or wider content columns)
```

## Code Conventions

- **No comments** unless the WHY is non-obvious. No docstrings.
- **CSS Modules** for all component styles. Global tokens via `:root` vars only.
- **No inline styles** except for dynamic values (color from data, etc.).
- TypeScript strict — no `any` except at Prisma boundaries.
- Zustand actions do optimistic updates first, then `await fetch(...)`.
- API routes always call `await auth()` from Clerk before touching the DB.
- `page.tsx` is always a Server Component — no `'use client'` there.
- Components under `components/` are always Client Components (`'use client'`) unless they have no interactivity.

---

## Key Constraints & Gotchas

- **Next.js 16 breaking changes** — this is NOT the Next.js you know from training. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before any Next.js-specific code. (See `AGENTS.md`.)
- The week view is a **vertical list of full-width day cards** (each row sizes independently, so adding meals never breaks the layout). Above it sits a compact 7-dot overview strip. NOTE: an earlier 7-column horizontal grid was removed — it caused cells to grow and overflow the screen.
- `WeekView` shows shimmer **skeleton rows** while `store.weekLoading` is true (set during `fetchWeek`).
- `buildShoppingList` in `helpers.ts` is pure — it derives the shopping list from `weekEntries + recurring` every render. Do not add side effects there.
- Prices are stored by **lowercase ingredient name** as the key.
- `weekOffset` 0 = this week, -1 = last week, +1 = next week. Week navigation re-fetches from API.
- Recurring meal slots are user-defined (add/rename/delete from WeekView). The old hardcoded brunch/lunch seed is removed; existing DB rows with those keys still work.

## Update Log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-24 | Initial CLAUDE.md created — baseline audit of existing codebase |
| 2026-05-30 | Design refresh Ph1+2: WeekView → vertical day cards + overview dots; lucide-react icons replace emoji chrome; compact header; spacing/radius/elevation/motion tokens; 3-color semantic tags (soft tints); week skeleton loaders; polished empty states |
| 2026-05-30 | Recipe instructions added end-to-end (`instructions String?` on Recipe; editor textarea; threaded through POST/PUT). AI import overhaul: URL import now reads JSON-LD `recipeInstructions` for free + switched ingredient/tag parsing to Haiku w/ structured output; photo import gains instructions + structured output (still Sonnet vision); new paste-raw-text import (`/api/import-text`, Haiku) for sites without JSON-LD |
| 2026-05-30 | Design refresh Ph3 (modals): base Modal uses tokens + desktop centered/pop-in (mobile sheet); DayModal cooking/not-cooking toggle + guest stepper + choose-recipe now Lucide icons, chosen-recipe emoji tinted, press states; RecipePicker has Search-icon input + SearchX empty state + tinted recipe avatars; PriceModal token buttons; Toast → floating pill w/ shadow-lg + scale-in |
| 2026-06-01 | Security audit: all routes already scoped by userId. Fixed IDOR in `POST /api/meals/[id]/recipes` (now verifies recipeId belongs to caller before attaching). Removed dead `if (!recipe)` in `GET /api/recipes/[id]`. Removed stale "known gap" note about page.tsx (it already filtered by userId). |
| 2026-06-01 | Recurring meals: user can add/rename/delete slots. Removed hardcoded brunch/lunch seed. Added POST/DELETE/PATCH to `/api/recurring`; new `addRecurring`/`deleteRecurring`/`renameRecurring` store actions; WeekView inline edit/delete/add UI; `recColor()` helper replaces hardcoded map. |
| 2026-06-01 | User-configurable stores: `Store = string` (was literal union). New `UserStore` model in Prisma + `GET/POST/DELETE /api/stores` (seeds Sprouts + Costco on first use). `stores: UserStore[]` in Zustand state with `fetchStores`/`addStore`/`deleteStore`. SSR passes `initialStores` from page.tsx. RecipeEditorModal renders dynamic store pills (generic Store icon). ShopView renders dynamic filter row + inline "Manage stores" panel (⚙ icon toggles add/delete UI). `Ingredient.store` remains `String` in DB — no migration needed. |
